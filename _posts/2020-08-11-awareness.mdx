During the lockdown I was based by myself in a small apartment in Dublin city centre for more than 3 months.  
I worked as a programmer for Zendesk and before the restrictions happened, apart from the intense coding sessions, I liked to fill my day with social activities; coffee, sports... and also some pints of Guinness or IPA with friends.  
While I was aware that this mix of things was part of building my happiness, I wasn't prepared to react once we were asked to start working from home and all the activities closed. I am sad to admit that my biggest mistake was thinking that everything would have just worked out naturally for me, without planning any strategy.  
I found myself waking up very early and my energy was gone the next day. It became difficult to separate my office from my home and to dedicate the right amount of time to the hobbies and pleasures that I needed to balance my life.
I consider myself lucky that neither me or any of my friends got the virus, but mentally I struggled a lot to adapt to the situation.  
I kept working for my employer as usual and having the office literally in the next room, at first was creating more problems than benefit; because even if all the recommendations about bewaring from overworking were given out, I just thought that I didn't need them.
For example I started working during lunch time, then reading a lot in the evening because I was afraid of missing out and suddenly I was out of time for a proper sleep.
Evening usually starts when work is done (Zendesk has nothing to be blamed about this, on the contrary they have always been supporting), because in the last years I started a personal battle against clocks.  
I used to wake up in the morning without alarm, stopping for a coffee when I saw other people having it, having lunch when I am hungry and a conversation keeps going about food!
In some extent I was proud of not having a watch in my apartment and looking at the time only when a meeting was scheduled.  
Bad sleep was the first symtpom telling me that I wasn't feeling good and when it was constantly happening, I tried to identify the possible causes:

- using the computer until too late (learning and solving problems turns me ON)
- I wasn't cooling down before going to bed
- watching one more episode of anything on Netflix and friends
- taking my phone to the bedroom
- getting nervous for not good reason
- I was going to sleep feeling guilty about not having done something during the day

Bad sleep to me means to throw the next day straight into the bin, I can survive the workday, but I don't really think soberly.  
This is a second symptom: start doing something and then unconsciously switching focus to something else without having control of my concentration.

Now the lock down is loosened, but still I find myself disoriented from time to time.
I am managing may day by day strictly, but trying not to fill every moment; planning one main important thing to do for the next
day and trying to put my focus and joy around it.  
I bought a [cheap nice anti technologic wrist clock](https://www.amazon.it/Casio-Orologio-Analogico-Cinturino-MQ-24-7BLL/dp/B000JNKABW/); I don't look at my phone anymore to know the time, because I am more sensitive to notifications that can unfocus me. I feel flabbergasted when I plan in advance to timebox an hour to do something funny (like playing the guitar) and then time is over so quickly in my mind.
Another good habit is to stop doing anything important at least 10 minutes before a meeting starts and prepare my mind for the focus switch.  
This has been a small good lesson for myself, I was never too depressed to be in danger, but I could have been; in the future I'll dedicate some time to logically plan my reactions to a change in my life and hopefully be more understanding towards people around me, living similar situations.
