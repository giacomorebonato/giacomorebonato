During the lockdown I was based by myself in a small apartment in Dublin (Ireland) city centre for more than 3 months.
I consider myself lucky that neither me or any of my friends got the virus, but mentally I struggled a lot to adapt to the situation.  
I found myself being awake sleepless very early in the morning and then been completely out of energy for the next day.
I kept working for my employer every day and having the office literally in the next room, at first was creating more problems than benefit, because I loved my cycling commute everyday and also stopping by places on my way back: tennis court, shopping, groceries.
I created I kind of a loop where I could be always satisfied and it was easy to adapt to sudden changes: I enjoy keeping myself busy.
When I couldn't move anymore into this flexible routine that I built for myself, I tried to see if I could just improvise,
doing some work, exercise, cooking, books, movies and just see how I was getting along.  
It didn't work out well at first, I noticed myself that I wasn't able to timebox any of my activities, I thought that I didn't have too, since all my hobbies and meetings in real life were gone.  
Bad sleep is the very first symptom, I learnt that most of the time this happens, then I have to change something in my actions or attitude.  
Possible causes:

- using the computer until too late (learning and solving problems turns me ON)
- watching one more episode of anything on Netflix and friends
- taking my phone to the bedroom
- taking some work task too seriously

Bad sleep to me means to throw the next day straight into the bin, I can survive the workday, but I don't really think soberly.  
This is a second symptom:

> start doing something and then finding myself doing something else without having control of myself
> didn't have control of my concentration, another precious thing to me.

Now the lock down is loosened, but still I find myself disoriented from time to time.
I am managing may day by day strictly, but trying not to fill every moment; planning one main thing to do the next
day and trying to put my focus and joy around it.  
It seems something easily achievable... yet I have to be careful that this never goes out of my control.
