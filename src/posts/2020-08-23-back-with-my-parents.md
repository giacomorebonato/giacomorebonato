Only one month ago I moved back living with my parents, it's just a temporary solution, since I declared my independence from them
long ago, but I am staying with them long enough to consider it not just an holiday.  
I am on a mission of thanking them by improving the tech side of the house; they are living just fine without me, but I want to
see if I can do any better from my past self.  
As a tech lover since young age (I was assembling desktop PC since 8) I changed a lot perspective over the years, now I think that you should avoid
anything techwise unless is bringin an improvement with seemless integration.  
So the challenge I am putting myself up for fun is to put care into the tech side of the house and see if my parents appreciate it, without being trained to it too much about it.

## Privacy

I have noticed my mother observing that she was often advertised by things that she wanted to buy, but having no clue how "the computer" could already know;
I decided then to [turn off web activity sharing on the Google settings](https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols/webandapp) with her approval.  
She doesn't need to be unconsciously advertised.

## Bikes

I started to use a race bike that my dad wasn't using and my parents started copying me by cycling more with their bikes.  
My dad enjoys to look after the bikes and I help him, but I had to tell him that the cheap pumps that he uses to pump the tires are not great.  
I got him this [portable electric pump by Xiaomi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiaJi-QTQ4M), I didn't know myself such a device existed.
So simple and useful, makes cycling even more approachable, which is a good thing.

## Enterntainment

I have seen them whatching the old classic tv with advertisement break and very often giving up to the end of a movie to go to bed.  
I made the tv smart with a Fire Tv Stick and some subscriptions included. I am battled whether this was a good thing to do and indeed they are not impressed.  
Sometimes I sit and whatch some tv show for myself and they follow a little bit with me and then they leave.  
Outside is hot and there are many things to do in the garden, I am thinking that I should just take step back about tv entertainment.

## Wifi

This was mostly for my sister and me... Some rooms were not wifi covered and that meant often share the same room while somebody was working and the other listening to music.  
Among many solutions I decided to go for a [mesh wifi router](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/what-is-mesh-wifi-router,news-24580.html) to improve internet connection.  
The idea is quite good, but I hope it doesn't lead to take to bring the laptop to bed too often or at all.

## Conclusion

In the end I don't know what exactly I am doing, my parents don't need to be parented by me and they are doing just happily fine with many healthy
good habits unrelated to technology.  
I guess that doing these things is just me expressing myself, still excited about technology that in the end is to me a funny toy, in many different aspects.  
Even if this is just temporary, I'll try to control myself to leave technology out from what works just fine.
